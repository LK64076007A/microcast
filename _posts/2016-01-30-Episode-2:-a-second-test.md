shownotes: The first podcast/test went well so I'm trying it again to make sure the first wasn't just beginner's luck. This time the whole thing was recorded, edited, uploaded, and published from my iPhone in the middle of nowhere with a 1x data connection using [Ferrite](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8&uo=4&at=11l4RT), [Working Copy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-powerful-git/id896694807?mt=8&uo=4&at=11l4RT), [Drafts 4](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&uo=4&at=11l4RT), and [Workflow](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&uo=4&at=11l4RT).
